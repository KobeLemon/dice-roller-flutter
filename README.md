# Tabletop Dice Roller

This is Tabletop Dice Roller! This is a mobile app that can be used to roll all different types, amounts, and combinations of dice! From a d2 coin, all the way up to a d100 percentage dice, and everything in between. This app shuffles several times through all numbers available for your chosen dice to simulate a real dice roll to make it as fair and accurate as possible. If you find yourself rolling the same combo of dice often, you can even save dice profiles for easy later use. Just select your dice, then hit **_Roll!_** to join the action!

I created this app to have a fun, interesting, and convenient way to roll dice. It's especially made for when you do not have dice with you, or when you want to keep them
